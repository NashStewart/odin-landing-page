# odin-landing-page
A landing page for a fictional company. The page contains a hero with header, an information 
section, a quote section, a call-to-action, and a footer.

## An Odin Project
The basic criteria and designs for styling come from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page). 
The implementation was all left up to myself.
